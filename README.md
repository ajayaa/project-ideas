# project-ideas

This is a repository to collect project ideas which come to my mind when
I am in a state of idea creation. Expect to find absurd, useless, duplicate,
new, wild, fun ideas. :)


When I am in a state of idea implementation I will prune this list to find
the worthwhile ideas and implement them hopefully.


New ideas and contributions are welcome. To contribute your ideas here
you must agree to the license. As of now I am not sure if the presence of
License file already enforces this.
