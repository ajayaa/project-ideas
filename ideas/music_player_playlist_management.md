Create a format of playlist which is portable across Operating system and music player.
Find out where to put these playlist files. Ideally it should be simple and editable
by any text editor. Try to keep the DSL easy and simple.

Extension
=========

Cloud based playlist
--------------------
* Sync the playlist file/directory to any cloud based storage.
* Then across devices/operating system find out if the song specified in the playlist
  is present. A fuzzy matching algorithm based on name could be used to find out if two songs are
  same. A sophisticated algorithm would fetch the music file from the device in which the playlist
  was created and prune all the fuzzy matched song files and the compare the music file itself.


Structure of playlists(For geeks and nerds)
-------------------------------------------
Create a tree layout of playlists and the user the should be able to specify the type of traversal
to play the songs. This idea could be extended to the playlists instead of the songs.
