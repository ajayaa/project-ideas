Whenver someone creates a meeting in outlook then create
a github commit with time and people information.


Then create a nice presentation out of it at the end day/week/monthly
and present it to the management.

The stats could be further presented in slack. A command can be added to
slack which would present this stat. If the current is not finished it could
present stats for last week, or stats so far this week.
